* Load/save project
* SVG and DXF as input formats for vector graphics
* PNG/JPG as input for heightmap (3d relief operations)
* Profile operations (inside or outside) with tabs, CW/CCW
* Pocket operations, CW/CCW
* Drill operations
* Engraving operations (follow path)
* Laser/plotter operation (m3/m5 for on/off)
* Relief operations (roughing and follow height)
* Import/Export user settings to file
* Plunge / ramp attack methods
* Level-first or depth-first
* Metric / imperial units
* Optimize-function to reduce operation time (genetic TSP algorithm)
* Move, scale, rotate 2d objects before toolpath generation. Lock to axis.
* Place pivot for scale/rotate
* Zoom-able/pan-able 2d view (mouse wheel for zoom, left-click/drag for pan)
